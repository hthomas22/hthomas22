## Objective

Graduating from Arizona State University in 2024 with a B.A. in Business (Information Security), I am deeply passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  I am also interested in cybersecurity, data analysis, asset management, global economics, and the potential that decentralization and blockchain have to improve these sectors. 

My goal in life is simple, try to create a better tomorrow than today.  I am aiming to join a team of individuals that is exploring creative ways to solve complex business problems to gain a competitive advantage for the future by taking advantage of blockchain or cryptocurrency.  I have said it for a while, and I will continue to until I am proven wrong, but i truly believe that decentralization is the key technology needed to move humanity forward.
